# NextWordGeneration

Next word generation, also known as language modeling or text prediction, is a natural language processing (NLP) task where a computer program or model predicts the most likely word or sequence of words that should come after a given input text or partial sentence.

This project is a next word generation model that can be used to generate the next word in a sentence.
